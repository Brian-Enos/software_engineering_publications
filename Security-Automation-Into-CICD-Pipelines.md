# **Security Automation Into CI/CD Pipelines**
# **Introduction**

Popular data breaches and service outages are showing us that security cannot be a one-off time job, is negligible and can be executed only at the end of the final stages of application development.

Otherwise, it’s not only affecting the company’s reputation but also customer loyalty to the delivered product and or service.

If security is implemented and limited at the final stages, then prevention or recovery is also taking much more time and money for spotting the correct point and figuring out the correct solution.

This can be easily avoided by changing the application development pipelines by introducing the correct tools and techniques at the right places.

This allows us to detect most of the security issues earlier than before delivering applications/services to the customer with the Shifting Security Alert.

## What is CI/CD?

To begin with, CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) is a software development approach that involves frequent integration of code changes into a central repository and automated testing and deployment of the changes to production. It aims to shorten the software development cycle (SDLC) and deliver software more quickly, reliably and efficiently.

Continuous Integration involves developers frequently merging their code changes into a shared repository, which is then built and tested automatically to detect integration errors early in the development cycle. This helps to ensure that code changes are properly integrated and that issues are detected and resolved quickly.

Continuous Delivery goes beyond Continuous Integration by automating the release of code changes to production. This involves deploying changes to a staging environment, running further tests, and then deploying the changes to production in a controlled manner. This helps to reduce the risk of errors and downtime during deployment and enables faster and more frequent releases.

Implementing security automation into CI/CD pipelines involves integrating security testing tools and processes into the pipeline to detect and prevent security vulnerabilities early in the development cycle.

## **Key Steps in Securing CI / CD Pipeline**

**Identify security requirements and risks**

Identify the security requirements for your application and assess the potential security risks. This will help you determine the type of security tests you need to include in your pipeline.

**Choose security testing tools**

Choose security testing tools that fit your requirements and integrate them into your pipeline. Popular security testing tools include SAST (Static Application Security Testing), DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing), and SCA (Software Composition Analysis) tools.

**Integrate security tests into the pipeline**

Integrate the chosen security testing tools into your pipeline, preferably as automated tests. This can be done using plugins, scripts, or APIs provided by the testing tools.

**Configure security tests**

Configure the security tests to run automatically as part of the pipeline and specify the threshold for the security tests to pass or fail. For example, you can set up the pipeline to fail if any critical vulnerabilities are detected.

**Monitor security test results**

Monitor the security test results and act upon any findings. This may involve fixing the vulnerabilities detected or making changes to the pipeline configuration to prevent similar vulnerabilities from occurring in the future.

**Implement security best practices**

Incorporate security best practices, such as secure coding standards, secure design patterns, and secure configuration management, into your development process to prevent security issues from occurring in the first place.

# Designing and Automating Security in the Planning Phase

The planning phase is the first stage in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and it sets the foundation for the entire software development project. The primary goal of the planning phase is to define the project's objectives, scope, and requirements, as well as to create a comprehensive project plan that outlines the project's timeline, budget, and resource requirements.

## **Key Steps in the planning phase**

### **Define project objectives**

The planning phase begins by defining the project objectives, which should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. This involves gathering information from stakeholders and other sources to understand the purpose and goals of the project.

### **Define project scope**

The next step is to define the project scope, which involves determining what the project will deliver, what it won't deliver, and the boundaries of the project. This helps to ensure that everyone involved in the project has a clear understanding of the project's goals and expectations.

### **Identify project requirements**

Once the project objectives and scope are defined, the next step is to identify the project requirements, which describe what the software system should do, how it should perform, and the characteristics it should have. Requirements gathering is a critical activity in the planning phase and involves interviewing stakeholders, conducting workshops, and analyzing existing systems and processes.

### **Create a project plan**

The project plan outlines the project's timeline, budget and resource requirements. This involves creating a work breakdown structure (WBS) that breaks down the project into smaller, more manageable tasks and estimating the time and resources required to complete each task.

### **Identify project risks**

The planning phase also involves identifying and assessing project risks, which are potential events or situations that could harm the project's success. This helps to ensure that the project team is aware of the risks and can take proactive measures to mitigate them.

### **Obtain approvals**

Once the project plan is developed, it needs to be reviewed and approved by key stakeholders, such as the project sponsor, project manager and other members of the project team. This ensures that everyone is aligned with the project's goals, objectives, and expectations.

> NOTE: The planning phase is a critical stage in the Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC, as it sets the stage for the entire project. A well-planned project can help to ensure that the project is completed on time, within budget, and meets the required quality standards.

### **Threat Modelling**

Threat modeling is a process used during the planning phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities in the software system being developed. The goal of threat modeling is to proactively identify security risks and weaknesses in the system and take steps to mitigate them.

**Key Steps in Threat Modelling**

* **Define the syste*m***
    

The first step in threat modeling is to define the system being developed, including its components, architecture, and functionality. This helps to ensure that the entire system is considered when identifying potential security risks.

* **Identify pote*ntial threats***
    

The next step is to identify potential threats to the system, such as unauthorized access, data breaches, denial of service attacks, or injection attacks. This involves brainstorming with the development team and other stakeholders to identify all possible attack vectors.

* **Identify assets and their values**
    

Once the potential threats are identified, the next step is to identify the assets in the system that are at risk of being compromised, such as data, applications, or infrastructure. Each asset is assigned a value based on its importance to the system and the organization.

* **Evaluate threats**
    

Once the assets are identified, the next step is to evaluate each potential threat and determine the likelihood of it occurring, as well as the impact it would have on the system and the organization.

* **Prioritize threats**
    

Based on the evaluation of each potential threat, the next step is to prioritize them based on their likelihood and impact. This helps to ensure that the most critical threats are addressed first.

* **Develop mitigations**
    

The final step in threat modeling is to develop mitigations to address the identified threats. This may involve implementing security controls, such as access controls, encryption, or monitoring, or modifying the system architecture to reduce the attack surface.

### **Standardizing Development Environment**

This involves defining a set of standards and guidelines for the development environment that will be used throughout the development process. The goal of standardizing the development environment is to ensure that all developers are working in a consistent and standardized environment, which can help to improve productivity, reduce errors and increase the quality of the software being developed.

**Key Steps in Standardizing the Development Environment**

# Designing and Automating Security in the Testing Phase

This refers to the process of integrating security testing into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and automating it to ensure that security vulnerabilities are identified and resolved early in the development process.

In the SDLC, security testing is typically performed during the testing phase, which comes after the development phase. The goal of security testing is to identify vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and flaws in the system or application being developed, and to ensure that it meets the security requirements specified by the stakeholders.

## Key Steps in this phase

**Identifying security requirements**

This involves identifying the security requirements of the system or application being developed, such as access control, data confidentiality, integrity, availability and other relevant security controls.

**Creating a security testing plan**

This involves creating a plan for security testing that defines the scope, objectives, and testing methodologies to be used during the testing phase.

**Implementing security testing**

This involves performing security testing to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the system or application being developed.

**Analyzing security test results**

This involves analyzing the results of security testing to identify security vulnerabilities and other security issues.

**Resolving security issues**

This involves resolving identified security vulnerabilities and other security issues.

> Automating security testing involves using automated tools and techniques to perform security testing. This can include tools for scanning code for vulnerabilities, performing penetration testing, and other automated security testing tools.

## This is achieved through:

* ### **Penetration Testing**
    
* ### **Load Testing**
    
* ### **Fuzz Testing**
    
* ### **Behavior-Driven Development Security**
    
* ### **Test Reporting with Junit/XUnit**
    

## **Penetration Testing**

Penetration testing, also known as pen-testing, is a type of security testing that is performed during the testing phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The primary objective of penetration testing is to identify security vulnerabilities in a system or application by simulating an attack from a malicious user.

### Key Steps in Penetration Testing

**Planning**

In this phase, the scope and objectives of the penetration test are defined. The tester identifies the targets to be tested, such as web applications, networks, or servers, and the type of testing to be performed.

**Scanning**

This phase involves using automated tools to scan the target systems or applications for vulnerabilities. This can include port scanning, vulnerability scanning, and other techniques.

**Gaining Access**

In this phase, the tester attempts to exploit vulnerabilities found during the scanning phase to gain access to the target systems or applications.

**Maintaining Access**

Once access has been gained, the tester attempts to maintain that access by escalating privileges and installing backdoors or other malicious software.

**Analysis**

This phase involves analyzing the results of the penetration test to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the system or application being tested. The tester then reports their findings and provides recommendations for mitigating identified vulnerabilities.

> NOTE: By identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the system or application, the tester can recommend changes to the design or implementation to improve the security posture of the system or application.

## **Load Testing**

Load testing is a type of performance testing used in the testing phase of the software development life cycle (SDLC). Its primary purpose is to determine how well an application or system can handle high levels of user traffic or activity.

It involves simulating realistic user loads and activity on the system or application being tested, typically with the help of specialized tools or software. The testing team sets up scenarios that simulate different levels of user activity, such as a high number of simultaneous user requests or heavy database access, and then monitors the system's response time, throughput, and resource utilization to determine how well it performs under these conditions.

The goal of load testing is to identify any performance bottlenecks, such as slow response times, server crashes, or other issues that could impact the user experience or the system's ability to handle high levels of traffic. Once these issues are identified, the development team can work to optimize the system's performance and ensure that it can handle the expected load.

### Key Steps in Load Testing

**Define the load test objectives**

Define the load test objectives by identifying the performance metrics that are important to your application, such as response time, throughput, or concurrency.

**Choose a load-testing tool**

Choose a load testing tool that can generate simulated traffic and measure the performance of your application, such as Apache JMeter, Gatling, or LoadRunner.

**Create the load test scenarios**

Create the load test scenarios by defining the simulated traffic patterns that will be used in the load test, such as the number of users, requests per second, or duration of the test.

**Configure the load-testing tool**

Configure the load testing tool to work with your application by providing the necessary information, such as the URL and credentials.

**Run the load test**

Run the load test to generate the simulated traffic and measure the performance of your application. This may involve scaling up your infrastructure to handle the load, depending on the volume of traffic generated.

**Analyze the results**

Analyze the results of the load test to identify any performance issues or bottlenecks that may be present in your application. This may involve reviewing the performance metrics, logs, and other data generated by the load-testing tool.

**Address the issues**

Address any performance issues or bottlenecks identified by the load test, such as optimizing code, tuning configurations, or scaling resources.

**Automate the load-testing process**

Automate the load testing process by integrating it into your CI/CD pipeline and configuring it to run as part of your build and deployment processes.

> NOTE:Load testing is a critical part of the testing phase in the SDLC because it helps to ensure that the system or application being developed can perform reliably and efficiently under real-world conditions. By identifying and addressing performance issues early in the development process, load testing can help to improve the overall quality and usability of the final product.

## **Fuzz Testing**

Fuzz testing is a type of testing used in the testing phase of the software development life cycle (SDLC). Its primary purpose is to identify security vulnerabilities and other types of software defects by sending unexpected or invalid input to the system or application being tested.

Fuzz testing involves using specialized tools or software to generate large volumes of random or semi-random input data and then sending this data to the system being tested. This input data may include malformed or invalid input, unexpected input values, or combinations of different inputs that are unlikely to occur in normal use.

The goal of fuzz testing is to identify unexpected behavior or errors that may be caused by the input data, such as crashes, hangs, or other types of software failures. Fuzz testing can also be used to identify security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or other types of input validation issues that could be exploited by an attacker.

### **Key Steps in Fuzz Testing**

**Identify the input sources**

The first step in fuzzing is to identify the input sources that the system or application accepts. These input sources may include user input, network traffic, file input, or other sources of input.

**Generate the fuzz data**

Fuzz data is generated using specialized tools or software. The fuzz data may include random or semi-random input data, malformed or invalid input, unexpected input values, or combinations of different inputs that are unlikely to occur in normal use.

**Send the fuzz data**

The generated fuzz data is then sent to the system or application being tested. This can be done manually or using automated tools.

**Monitor the system**

The system or application being tested is monitored for unexpected behavior or errors that may be caused by the fuzz data. This can include crashes, hangs, or other types of software failures.

**Analyze the results**

The results of the fuzzing tests are analyzed to identify any security vulnerabilities or other types of software defects. The results are typically recorded and reported to the development team for further investigation and remediation.

**Repeat the process**

The fuzzing process is iterative, and the steps are repeated until all identified input sources have been tested and all potential security vulnerabilities and other defects have been remediated.

> NOTE: Fuzz testing is a powerful technique for identifying software defects and security vulnerabilities because it can test for a wide range of scenarios and edge cases that may not be covered by traditional testing methods. However, fuzz testing can also generate a large volume of data and can be time-consuming to set up and run. Therefore, it is often used in combination with other testing methods to ensure that the system being tested is robust and secure.

## **Behavior Driven Development Security (BDD)**

Behavior-driven development (BDD) is an approach to software development that focuses on defining and testing the behavior of a system or application from the perspective of its users or stakeholders. BDD emphasizes collaboration between developers, testers, and other stakeholders to ensure that the software being developed meets the needs and expectations of its users.

Security testing is an important part of BDD, as it helps to ensure that the software being developed is secure and meets the security requirements of its users. In BDD, security testing is typically integrated into the development and testing process from the beginning, rather than being treated as a separate phase.

BDD emphasizes the use of "user stories" to define the behavior of the system or application being developed. These user stories describe the desired behavior of the system from the perspective of its users, and they are used to guide the development and testing process.

Security testing in BDD involves defining security-focused user stories that describe the security requirements and expectations of the system's users. These user stories may include scenarios that test the system's ability to handle different types of security threats or attacks, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

The security-focused user stories are then used to guide the development and testing process, ensuring that security is considered at every stage of the SDLC. Developers and testers work together to ensure that the system is designed and implemented to meet the security requirements and expectations of its users.

### **Key Steps in BDD**

**Define user stories**

In BDD, development begins with defining user stories that describe the behavior of the system or application from the perspective of its users. These user stories are used to guide the development and testing process.

**Define scenarios**

Each user story is broken down into scenarios that describe specific interactions with the system or application. These scenarios are used to define the desired behavior of the system.

**Define acceptance criteria**

Acceptance criteria are used to define the conditions that must be met for a scenario to be considered "complete." Acceptance criteria ensure that the system is meeting the needs and expectations of its users.

**Write automated tests**

Once the scenarios and acceptance criteria have been defined, automated tests are written to verify that the system is behaving as expected. These tests are typically written using a testing framework like Cucumber or Behave.

**Implement the code**

The developers then implement the code to make the tests pass. The code is written to meet the acceptance criteria defined in the scenarios.

**Run the tests**

The automated tests are then run to ensure that the system is behaving as expected. If any tests fail, the developers make changes to the code to address the issues.

**Refactor the code**

As the development process progresses, the developers may need to refactor the code to improve its quality, maintainability, and performance.

**Repeat the process**

The BDD process is iterative, and the steps are repeated until the desired behavior of the system has been achieved.

## **Test Reporting with jUnit /xUnit**

JUnit and xUnit are widely used open-source testing frameworks that provide a rich set of tools and APIs for automated testing of software applications. These frameworks also provide a built-in reporting mechanism that can be used to generate detailed reports on the results of testing

Developers write test cases using JUnit/xUnit to ensure that their code meets the requirements and specifications of the system or application being developed.

**Running tests**

Test cases are run using the JUnit/xUnit framework. These tests are executed automatically and generate results that can be used to assess the quality and functionality of the code being tested.

**Collecting results**

The results of the tests are collected and analyzed using JUnit/xUnit. The frameworks provide various tools for collecting and organizing test results, including reports that can be viewed in various formats.

**Analyzing results**

The test results are analyzed to identify any errors, defects, or other issues that need to be addressed. Developers can use this information to make changes to their code and ensure that it meets the required quality and functionality standards.

**Generating reports**

JUnit/xUnit provides built-in reporting mechanisms that can be used to generate detailed reports on the results of testing. These reports can be customized and configured to meet the specific needs of the project or organization. Reports may include information such as test case pass/fail status, code coverage, and performance metrics.

**Sharing reports**

The generated reports can be shared with stakeholders, including developers, testers, and project managers, to provide a clear and concise overview of the testing process and results. This helps ensure that everyone involved in the project is aware of the status of the testing and can take appropriate actions if needed.

# **Designing and Automating Security in the Release Phase**

## **This is achieved through**

* ### **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**
    
* ### **Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)**
    

## **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST**

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a type of security testing that is used in the release phase of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). DAST involves testing an application by simulating attacks on the application while it is running.

During the DAST process, the application is scanned for potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses that can be exploited by attackers. DAST tools typically simulate attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other web application attacks. These attacks are conducted by sending malicious input to the application and observing the application's response.

DAST is used in the release phase of the SDLC to ensure that the application is secure and free from vulnerabilities before it is released to the public. DAST can be used to identify security issues that may have been missed during other phases of the SDLC, such as the design and development phases.

### **Key Steps in DAST**

DAST is a cost-effective way to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the application, reducing the risk of security incidents and data breaches.

## **Interactive Application Security Testing( IAST)**

Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) is a type of security testing that is used in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in an application while it is running. Unlike traditional security testing methods, which are conducted outside the application, IAST is an internal testing method that analyzes the application's code while it is executing.

IAST works by instrumenting the application's code to monitor its behavior and identify potential security issues. This allows IAST to identify vulnerabilities that may not be detected by other testing methods.

### **Key Steps in IAST**

**Instrumentation**

The first step in IAST is to instrument the application's code to monitor its behavior while it is executing. This involves adding code to the application to track its execution and identify potential security issues.

**Analysis**

Once the application is instrumented, the IAST tool can analyze the application's behavior to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

**Reporting**

The IAST tool generates a report that summarizes the results of the testing process. The report should include details of any vulnerabilities identified, their severity, and recommendations for remediation.

**Remediation**

Once vulnerabilities have been identified, the development team can remediate the issues by fixing the code, updating the application's configuration, or implementing additional security controls.

### **The benefits of using IAST in the SDLC include:**

**Early detection**

IAST can detect vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the application early in the SDLC, making it easier and less costly to remediate.

**Real-time testing**

IAST can identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in real-time as the application is executing, providing more accurate and relevant results than traditional testing methods.

**Accurate results**

IAST can provide more accurate results than other testing methods because it analyzes the application's code while it is running.

Reduced false positives: IAST can reduce the number of false positives generated by other testing methods by analyzing the application's code in real time.

There are many tools available for monitoring various aspects of the system, including performance monitoring tools, network monitoring tools, and security monitoring tools. It is important to choose the right tool for the job.

**Establish monitoring policies**

It is important to establish monitoring policies to ensure that monitoring is performed consistently and effectively. This may include specifying what metrics to monitor, how often to monitor them, and what actions to take in response to anomalies.

**Configure monitoring tools**

Once the monitoring policies are established, the monitoring tools must be configured to collect and report the appropriate metrics. This may involve configuring thresholds and alerts to trigger notifications when anomalies are detected.

**Analyze monitoring data**

Once monitoring is in place, it is important to regularly analyze the monitoring data to detect issues and anomalies. This may involve manual analysis or the use of automated analysis tools.

**Take corrective action**

When issues or anomalies are detected, it is important to take appropriate corrective action to maintain the system's performance, availability, and security.

### **Key Steps in Monitoring**

**Planning**

The first step in monitoring involves planning what needs to be monitored, defining monitoring requirements, and identifying the key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to evaluate the software application's performance. This includes determining the appropriate tools and techniques that will be used for monitoring.

**Design**

In this step, the monitoring architecture is designed, including the collection, storage, and analysis of monitoring data. This step also involves selecting and implementing the appropriate monitoring tools and technologies.

**Implementation**

This step involves implementing the monitoring solution that was designed in the previous step. This includes installing the monitoring tools and configuring them to collect the necessary data.

**Testing**

Once the monitoring solution has been implemented, it needs to be tested to ensure that it is working as expected. This includes validating the monitoring data and ensuring that the KPIs are accurately measured and reported.

**Deployment**

After testing, the monitoring solution is deployed into the production environment, where it will continuously collect data and generate reports.

**Analysis**

In this step, the monitoring data is analyzed to identify any issues or anomalies that may require attention. This includes identifying trends and patterns in the data, identifying the root cause of any issues, and making recommendations for improvement.

**Maintenance**

The final step in monitoring involves ongoing maintenance of the monitoring solution. This includes monitoring the performance of the monitoring tools, ensuring that the data is being accurately collected and reported, and making any necessary adjustments to the monitoring solution to keep it functioning optimally.

## **Alerting and SIEMs**

Alerting and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) are two critical components of a comprehensive monitoring solution that are commonly used in the software development life cycle (SDLC) to improve application security and performance.

Alerting is a proactive monitoring technique that involves setting up alerts or notifications to alert IT teams of potential issues before they escalate into significant problems. The alerts can be triggered by predefined thresholds or rules that are based on specific metrics or events. For example, an alert may be triggered when CPU usage reaches a certain threshold, or when an application error is detected. The IT team can then investigate the alert and take corrective action before the issue affects the application's performance.

SIEM is a centralized security management system that collects, aggregates and analyzes security-related data from various sources, including network devices, servers and applications. SIEM solutions use machine learning and advanced analytics to identify patterns and anomalies in the data, allowing IT teams to quickly detect and respond to potential security threats. For example, if the SIEM system detects an unusual login attempt, it can trigger an alert to the IT team, who can then investigate the issue and take appropriate action to prevent any potential data breaches.

**Key Steps In Alerting and SIEMs**

**Define monitoring requirements**

The first step is to define the monitoring requirements for the application. This includes identifying the key performance indicators (KPIs) and events that need to be monitored, as well as the thresholds or rules that will trigger alerts.

**Select an alerting or SIEM solution**

There are various alerting and SIEM solutions available, and the right solution will depend on the specific needs and requirements of the application. It's important to consider factors such as scalability, ease of use, and integration with existing systems.

**Configure the solution**

Once the alerting or SIEM solution has been selected, it needs to be configured to collect and analyze the relevant data. This may involve installing agents or sensors on the application servers, configuring data sources, and defining rules or thresholds for alerting.

**Test the solution**

Before deploying the solution in production, it's essential to test it in a development or staging environment. This will help ensure that the alerts are triggered correctly and that the SIEM system is correctly identifying potential security threats.

**Deploy the solution**

Once the solution has been tested, it can be deployed in the production environment

## **Chaos Engineering**

Chaos Engineering is the practice of intentionally creating controlled experiments on a system to identify potential vulnerabilities or failures in the system's design or infrastructure, and then using that information to improve the system's resilience and reliability. In software development, Chaos Engineering is typically used as part of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to test and improve the system's ability to handle unexpected events or failures.

## **Key Steps in Chaos Engineering**

**Defining the System's Normal Behavior**

Before starting any experiments, it is important to have a clear understanding of what the system's normal behavior looks like. This includes identifying how the system should respond to different inputs and requests, what its performance metrics should be, and what its overall reliability should be.

**Identifying Potential Failure Modes**

The next step is to identify potential failure modes or ways in which the system could fail or become compromised. This could include hardware failures, software bugs, network disruptions, or other unexpected events.

**Designing and Executing Experiments**

Based on the identified failure modes, the Chaos Engineering team designs and executes experiments to intentionally trigger failures in the system. These experiments are carefully controlled and monitored to ensure that they do not cause any permanent damage to the system or its data.

**Analyzing results and making improvements**

Once the experiments are complete, the results are carefully analyzed to identify any weaknesses or vulnerabilities in the system. This information is then used to make improvements to the system's design, infrastructure, or processes, to improve its resilience and reliability.
